# Client Sorting App

A small demo application built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Tailwind CSS** that displays a table of clients and allows the user to **sort the table dynamically** using a drag-and-drop **Sort Panel**.  
Sort preferences are persisted in **localStorage**, so they survive page refreshes.
